# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)








#   insert into podcasts (name, feed, url, active, created_at, updated_at)
#   select po_name name, po_feed feed, po_url url, po_active active, UTC_TIMESTAMP, UTC_TIMESTAMP
#   from pdrnk.podcasts;
