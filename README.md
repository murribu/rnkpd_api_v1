# Rnkpd API  
So, I have [rnkpd.com][] - and it's currently running a Laravel/Angular service that has some podcasting related features.
[rnkpd.com]: http://rnkpd.com

This was my attempt to explore Authentication and Authorization in a Rails world, with the pretence of re-building the rnkpd application as an Rails API.   
I was able to get Clearance and Doorkeeper working, and could build the application from here.   
But for the next step in my learning, I plan to roll my own Oauth situation
